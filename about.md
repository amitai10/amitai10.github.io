Hi, I’m Amitai Barnea, A software developer and tech lead at Spectory. <br>
Spectory provides software consultancy and development services to a variety customers and technologies. <br>
My job includes design, architecture and bootstrapping new projects ([list of projects](#partial-list-of-the-projects-and-applications-that-i-was-involved-in)) and developing complicated modules. I tutor my other teammates, by helping them design their features, give a good advice when they run into difficulties and making code reviews. <br>
I’m a self-learner, I read tech books, study online courses, and tutorials. I conduct dev meetings in Spectory and share my knowledge with my teammates.<br>
I code in many languages and technologies: JavaScript, Ruby On Rails, C#, Java, Elixir, Angular(1 - 5), React, React Native, Redux, NodeJS, Cordova, Ionic, UWP (Microsoft's UI technology) and more. <br>
I can handle any technology in any domain, from the web to IOT, from drivers to UI. <br>
I’m enthusiastic about software and technologies, mainly open source and web. I stay tuned for new technologies by reading blogs, newsletters, and podcasts.<br>
I write about things that are interesting to me, give my perspective and experience of things that I’m working on.  <br><br>
I'm a father of three lovely daughters.  
In my free time, I like to run, yoga and play piano and guitar. <br>
