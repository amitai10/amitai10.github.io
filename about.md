Hi, I'm Amitai Barnea, A software developer and tech lead at Spectory.   
Spectory provides software consultancy and development services in a variety customers and technologies.   
My job includes design, architecture and bootstrapping new projects and developing complicated modules. I tutor my other team mates, by helping them design their features, give a good advice when they run into difficulties and making code reviews.
I'm a self learner, I read tech books, study online courses and tutorials. I conduct dev meetings in spectory and share my knowledge with my team mates.  
I code in many languages and technologies: JavaScript, Ruby On Rails, C#, Java, Elixir, Angular(1 - 5), React, React Native, Redux, NodeJS, Cordova, Ionic, UWP (microsoft's UI technology) and more.   
I can handle any technology in any domain, from web to IOT, from drivers to UI.

I'm enthusiastic about software and technologies, mainly open source and web. I stay tuned about new technologies by reading blogs, newsletters and podcasts. 

In my free time I like to run, yoga and play piano and guitar.

I write about things that are interesting for me, give my perspective and experience of things that I'm working on.
