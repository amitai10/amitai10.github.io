JavaScript is great, but comparing to other programing languages it has many confusing parts. One of them is the use of __this__.


In this blog post I will explain how to use it right, and what are the tools that JavaScript provide us to ease the use of it. In the end, I will focus on react.


## 3 types of functions
There 3 types of functions in JavaScript: 
 - Constructor
 - Function
 - Method

### constructor
Constructor is a function that is used to create new object with the same prototype using the __new__ keyword:
```JavaScript
function Person() {
  this.name = 'amitai';
}
var newPerson = new Person();

console.log(newPerson.name); // ‘amitai’
```
As we can see, we used __this__ in order to set a member of _Person_. When the constructor invoked, this.name got the value of ‘amitai’. And the object _newPerson_ had the property _name_ with the value _amitai_


### function
Function is a "function" if it is not a property of an object:
```JavaScript
function foo() {
  console.log(this); // undefined in “strict mode” or the global variable
}
```
In this case, __this__ will be the global variable, or undefined if we use “use strict”.


### method
Method is a function that is defined as a property of an object:
```JavaScript
var person = {
  fullName: function() {
       return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  }
}

person.firstName = 'Amitai';
person.lastName = 'Barnea';
console.log(person.fullName()); // ‘Amitai Barnea’
```
In methods, __this__ is used to refer to other properties of the object, in this case, to _firstName_ and _lastName_.


## What’s the problem?
After we understand the differences between the different function types, it is time to describe the problem.  
> Unlike variables, the this keyword does not have a scope, and nested functions do not
> inherit the this value of their caller. If a nested function is invoked as a method, its
> this value is the object it was invoked on. (JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, David Flanagan)


It means that there are times that we expect that __this__ will be defined with our object, but it is something completely different!
```JavaScript
var person = {
  fullName: function () {
    var calcFullName = function () {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    }
    return calcFullName();
  }
}
person.firstName = 'Amitai';
person.lastName = 'Barnea';
console.log(person.fullName()); // Undefined!!!
```

The inner function (_calcFullName_) doesn’t aware of __this__ and returns undefined.

This example is not very usefull, but it is very common to use inner functions, especially in callbacks, for instance:
```JavaScript
var person = {
  fullName: function (cb) {
    $.get('api/getStatus')
    .then(function(data) {
      this.status = data;
    })
  }
}
```
It will not work, person.status will be undefined because __this__ was not the object in the  callback function.


## The solution
There are 3 solutions for this problem. As JavaScript got more mature the solutions has been improved.

### ES3
In ES3 there was no solution to this problem, but there was a work around:
```JavaScript
var person = {
  fullName: function () {
    var that  = this;
    var calcFullName = function () {
      return that.firstName + ' ' + that.lastName
    }
    return calcFullName();
  }
}

person.firstName = 'Amitai';
person.lastName = 'Barnea';
console.log(person.fullName()); // 'Amitai Barnea'
```
Because JavaScript uses [closures](https://www.spectory.com/blog/Diving%20into%20JavaScript%20Closures), we took __this__ and put it into __that__. __that__ is in the scope of the inner function and the method is working.


### ES5
ES5 introduced a more elegant solution using the __bind__ method. The __bind__ method is part of the function prototype. It takes the function and bind it to the object that it got in its arguments.
```JavaScript
function addToMe(y) {
  return this.x + y;
}

var num = {
  x: 3
}

var AddToNum = addToMe.bind(num);
console.log(AddToNum(4)); // 7
```
After the __bind__, the function is acting on the object it got.
So how can it solve our problem? We will use bind to connect the inner function to  __this__:
```JavaScript
var person = {
  fullName: function () {
    var calcFullName = function () {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    }
    calcFullName = calcFullName.bind(this);
    return calcFullName();
  }
}

person.firstName = 'Amitai';
person.lastName = 'Barnea';
console.log(person.fullName()); // 'Amitai Barnea'
```
It is working!
Actually, __bind__ is even stronger, and can pass additional parameters to the function I will not go any deeper on this subject here.


### ES6
ES6 fixed this flaw of the language with its arrow functions. Not only that arrow functions are more elegant, they are also inject __this__ into the in their invocation. Now we can write the code like that;
```JavaScript
var person = {
  fullName: function () {
    var calcFullName =  () => {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    }
    return calcFullName();
  }
}

person.firstName = 'Amitai';
person.lastName = 'Barnea';
console.log(person.fullName()); // 'Amitai Barnea'
```
And it is working!


## How to imply it in React?
In react we use components that are classes that derived from React.Component. Many times we invoke functions from the component’s controllers that need data either from the component’s props or state by using _this.props_ or _this.state_.   
Because this is an inner function, __this__ is not available in the function. We can solve it in two ways:

Using __bind__ in the constructor of the function:
```JavaScript
import React, {Component} from 'react';


class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.onSubmit = this.onSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  onSubmit() {
    this.props.submit(this.state)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        ...
      </form>
    );
  }
}
export default MyComponent;
```
Using __arrow functions__:
```JavaScript
import React, {Component} from 'react';


class MyComponent extends Component {
  onSubmit = () => {
    this.props.submit(this.state)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        ...
      </form>
    );
  }
}


export default MyComponent;


```
Of course, if you are using ES6, use the arrow function to get cleaner and elegant solution.
